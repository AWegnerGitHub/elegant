## Elegant - Technical Nitty-Gritty

### License

The license requires that you give credit to me, Talha Mansoor, as the author
of the Elegant theme on every site that uses this theme. I have placed the
attribution in the footer of every page. Do not remove it. If you need to
remove or change the style of the attribution, please get in [touch with
me](http://oncrashreboot.com/#about-me) first.

Along with this attribution clause, Elegant theme is licensed under The MIT
License.

If you use my theme, I would love to hear from you. [Get in
touch](http://oncrashreboot.com/#about-me) and let me know about it. I may link
to your site too.

### Contribute

Front end design is not my strong suite. I must have made some blunders in this
design unknowingly. Please don't let me go away with buggy code.

- File bugs at [Github
  issues](https://github.com/Pelican-Elegant/elegant/issues)
- Share your ideas about the design in the comments below
- And most of all contribute improvements to [this
  project](https://github.com/Pelican-Elegant/elegant/)

There are two problem areas that I can think of,

1. Internet Explorer support
1. Web safe fonts. I developed this theme on a MacBook Retina. Although I have
   tried to make sure it looks great on all platforms but it still needs polish

Besides these, there must be other bugs that I haven't noticed yet. I need your
help to hunt them down and make them behave.
